Sheep herding using birds

Limited space:
	the ship that takes the sheep only has 10 spaces
	the map gets smaller overtime, sweep from left  to right
	the sheep can only carry 1 item (bag)
	
the map is randomly generated, with a few sheep some food spots and items,
	later on some obstacles like enemies.
the player has to guide the sheep to the ship on the right side of the map, the
	sheep need to feed (rest) collect the items and avoid obstacles.
	after every map you get points to upgrade your birds

mechanics
	sheep flock together (to their nearest sheep) avoid the birds and map edges
		when under treshold they will feed
	sheep carry over from map to map and enter from the left
	the wall advances from the left after 1 minute it moves closer every 10 seconds
	birds fly towards the mouse, avoid scarecrows and leave the map after some time
